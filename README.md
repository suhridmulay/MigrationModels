# Migration Models

This repository contains code using which migrations (between population centres) can be modelled and predicted. Migrations are based on simple differentials like quality of life and can further be affected by certain modifiers. A sample with two centers and two modifiers has been included in code but the model is arbitrarily extensible to any number of centres.
